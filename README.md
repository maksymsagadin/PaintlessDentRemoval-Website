## Objective
The goal of this project was to create a modern, responsive business landing page website that provides a smooth and engaging user experience.

## Summary
This project highlights my expertise in crafting modern, user-friendly websites that engage and retain users. By using React.js, Styled Components, and GraphCMS, I designed and developed a responsive business landing page website that boasts a smooth scrolling NavBar with animated content and a Modal window for optimal content presentation. The integration with GraphCMS made for effortless content management, enabling quick and easy updates through a user-friendly interface. To enhance data query management, I also utilized Apollo Client to ensure seamless and efficient query calls.
